      Changed the icon link to point to your new logo. 
      Using %PUBLIC_URL% ensures it works correctly in development and production builds.

      Removed the apple-touch-icon link for simplicity, 
      as the primary request was for the main favicon.
      If you need a specific touch icon for iOS, it can be re-added.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
